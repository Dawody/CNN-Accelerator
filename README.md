# CNN-Accelerator
Convolution Neural Networks Accelerator Hardware Unit

Detailed design for a Convolution & Pooling layer algorithm for CNN Accelerator.<br>
The system is built for grey-leveled images (each pixel has range between 0 to 255).<br>
The main objective of the project is building the accelerator module.
